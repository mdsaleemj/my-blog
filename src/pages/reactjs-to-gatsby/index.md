Gatsby made developing website possible using React stack. I couldn't imagine how React which started as perfect tool for developing SPA ( when Angular 1 started well but failed miserably) and integrated well with supporting tools(like Webpack, Babel, CSS in JS libraries) and now in the land of developing websites , it has received outstanding ovation. It's actually React which helped developers to migrate to ES6 related features very easily.

 React community popularized the usage of ES6 in the last few years for old/new Javascript developers. Thank You ReactJS community for giving such a wonderful thing .
 
 Thank You Gatsby for taking this forward and giving back to community , a real super easy way for developing websites.

Happy Dev<br/>
